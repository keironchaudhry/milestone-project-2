Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game inspired by the well-known scene in the famed Big Bang Theory television series, in which one of the main protagonists, Sheldon Cooper, explains in an absurd manner a rendition of the original well-known Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Here I have made an interactive version of the game using HTML, CSS and Javascript as part of the Code Institute Milestone Project 2. 

Users of the game will contend against the computer, which generates a hand choice at random. This site is a fun game, targeted towards adults and children, as it is based on pop-culture, is simple to use and quick to learn.
