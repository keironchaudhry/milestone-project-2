Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game inspired by the well-known scene in the famed Big Bang Theory television series, in which one of the main protagonists, Sheldon Cooper, explains in an absurd manner a rendition of the original well-known Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Here I have made an interactive version of the game using HTML, CSS and Javascript as part of the Code Institute Milestone Project 2. 

Users of the game will contend against the computer, which generates a hand choice at random. This site is a fun game, targeted towards adults and children, as it is based on pop-culture, is simple to use and quick to learn.  

The website contains two pages, the landing page with the gameplay tools and a guide page, with instructions. Both pages are linked via buttons and are easily accessible. 

A deployed version of the website can be found here: https://keironchaudhry.github.io/milestone-project-2/

**Requirements**

To create an interactive front-end site, which responds to the users' actions and how they interact with the site in engaging with data and alter the way the site displays information based on conditional criteria. The development of the site should be controlled and documented through Github. 

The required technologies are Javascript, CSS and HTML.
